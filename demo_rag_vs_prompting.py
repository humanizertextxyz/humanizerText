The shift has created new economic winners and losers. Real estate markets in major cities are struggling as demand for office space plummets, while suburban home prices are soaring. Local businesses that relied on office workers are closing, but delivery services and home improvement companies are booming. It's a classic case of creative destruction in action.",

The lack of spontaneous interactions that used to happen in office hallways has created a sense of isolation. Some workers are struggling with the blurring of work and personal life boundaries. The constant video calls can be exhausting, and the absence of non-verbal cues makes communication more challenging. It's not just about productivity anymore; it's about human connection.",
